# BLACKJACK TERMINAL APP

## PLANNING PHASE
### User Flow
* Welcome the user
* Output user's current balance
* If user balance is **less than $25**, we ask user to add funds or quit the application
* If user balance is **greater than $25**, we deal them their first two cards
* Ask them if they want to hit or stay
* If they want to hit, deal another card
* If they want to stay, changes to dealer's turn!
* If their card total exceeds 21 or is less than dealer hand, game ends and we deduct funds from user's account
* If their card total is equal to 21 or card total is greater than dealer, than user recieves funds
